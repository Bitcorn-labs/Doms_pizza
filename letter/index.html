            <p>Dear Community,</p>
            <p>
              Almost one year before the writing of this letter, <a href="https://sqbzf-5aaaa-aaaam-aavya-cai.ic0.app/" target="_blank">SNS-1 introduced a vision</a> for a fully on-chain, 
              community-driven Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO). As a blank canvas provided by the DFINITY Foundation, 
              the community was asked to be the engineer of this first true web3 DAO — its fate steered by a collective spirit. 
              However, on June 11th, 2023, a new chapter for SNS-1 unfolded as the Dragginz team acquired it for their web3 MMO.
              While we may disagree with the centralizing of the Dragginz governance system, we are rooting for the success of Dragginz,
              like the rest of the ICP community. 
              Yet, as the final chapter of SNS-1 being a decentralized blank canvas concluded, a group of early SNS-1 community 
              members gathered to resurrect the original vision of SNS-1.
            </p>
            <p>
              SNEED is here to carry on the torch from the SNS-1, to form a DAO owned and led by the ICP community, 
              for the benefit of the ICP community. 
              The foundation of SNEED rests on five pillars: Security, Non-inflation, Eco-friendliness, Efficiency, and Decentralization, 
              which are made possible by the 
              This is the vision of SNEED. but we dont care about sneeds vision
